This is a small project where I used excel and postgreSQL in order to create and analyze a food selling business.

The data was generated randomly online and was cleaned and organized using excel to help with the value insertion.

Begin by creating the database and use "Table Creation.sql" file to create tables. Then start by adding values to the Staff, Customer, Food, Orders and OrderDetails tables by the exact order mentioned to respect foreign key creation using the .sql files respectively. Be advised that I used postgreSQL and the syntax may change with others.

I have chosen 15 questions in order to analyze this business from financial and societal perspectives. The questions are located in the Analysis powerpoint file accompanied with snapshots of the code and results. In addition I have uploaded a text file with the same questions and code so that anyone can experiment with the code.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate SQL knowledge as well as business acumen by asking and answering questions to help management with the decision making.


I'm more than happy to answer any inquiries concerning the code or the questions answered in the Business Analysis.
